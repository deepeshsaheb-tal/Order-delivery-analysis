# Logistics Insights Engine - Project Tasks

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a console application that analyzes logistics data to identify causes of delivery failures and delays. The system will aggregate multi-domain data, correlate events automatically, generate human-readable insights, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Task List

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Processing

#### 001. Project Structure Setup
- Create directory structure for the application
- Initialize Git repository
- Create README.md with project overview
- Set up virtual environment
- Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies

#### 002. Data Loading Module
- Create data loader for CSV files
- Implement data validation and cleaning
- Add error handling for missing or corrupted files
- Create data models/classes for each data type

#### 003. Data Preprocessing Module
- Implement date/time normalization
- Create address standardization functions
- Develop text preprocessing for feedback analysis
- Implement data enrichment with external factors

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine Development

#### 004. Data Correlation Engine
- Develop algorithms to link orders with fleet logs
- Create functions to correlate warehouse data with delivery performance
- Implement methods to associate external factors with delivery outcomes
- Build customer feedback analysis with order status

#### 005. Root Cause Analysis Module
- Implement failure categorization logic
- Create delay pattern recognition algorithms
- Develop statistical analysis for common failure points
- Build predictive models for delivery risks

#### 006. Insights Generation Module
- Create natural language generation for insights
- Implement recommendation engine based on patterns
- Develop priority scoring for recommendations
- Build narrative structure for presenting findings

### Phase 3: Query Engine and User Interface

#### 007. Natural Language Query Processor
- Integrate OpenAI API for query understanding
- Implement query parsing for entities (city, client, warehouse, time period)
- Create query classification system
- Develop context management for follow-up questions

#### 008. Console User Interface
- Create main application entry point
- Implement command-line argument parsing
- Design interactive query interface
- Build results presentation formatting



## Sample Use Cases

The system will address queries such as:
- Why were deliveries delayed in city X yesterday?
- Why did Client X's orders fail in the past week?
- Explain the top reasons for delivery failures linked to Warehouse B in August?
- Compare delivery failure causes between City A and City B last month?
- What are the likely causes of delivery failures during the festival period, and how should we prepare?
- If we onboard Client Y with ~20,000 extra monthly orders, what new failure risks should we expect and how do we mitigate them?
